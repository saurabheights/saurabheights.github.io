Ladies and gentlemen, astronomers and stargazers, welcome aboard the interstellar expedition to the portfolio planet of Saurabh! 
As we navigate the cosmic sea of knowledge, rest assured that I, a seasoned computer vision specialist, shall be your guide on this momentous journey. 
Alas, our destination is not yet visible to the naked eye, for this celestial website remains in the phase of orbital construction. 
The fuel that propels our progress includes CSS, JS, and bootstrap - trusty rocket landing parts that I am diligently mastering. 
Together, we shall [witness](https://saurabheights.github.io/Changelog) the transformation of this digital asteroid into a grandiose platform, showcasing a decade's worth of visual accomplishments. 
As we approach the portfolio planet, be mindful of the last trajectory correction on 09-08-2023. 
Brace yourselves for a stellar experience!
